# AHK-Libraries
A collection of libraries I've written in AHK.

This program allows users to automate downloading mods from the Curseforge website by pasting links into a notepad document, and then opening said links via the user's default browser. Equally, it allows users to filter by version, as well as saving mod links from the toolbar by copying them to the clipboard.
This program was developed by Skibbsies, and is publicly available for free use. Users may use/edit/compile/decompile this program and its affiliated source code as they wish, in accordance with the programming language's terms of use/service.
